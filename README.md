# ImportFinder

How to run:
* Option 1:
    ```
    npm start <path to repo> <result path>
    ```
    If you don't provide a result path, it will default to `./extracted-imports.json`.


* Option 2:
    In `main.ts` hardcode the path to the repo and the result path and just run:
    ```
    npm start
    ```
